# Sam's dotfiles

These are my personal configs, the way that I like them. Feel free to use or take inspiration from them but do not expect support, guarantees, or adaptability of any kind beyond what is desirable for me.
Caveat emptor, there are scripts here that can completely whipe or otherwise brick your system if you don't know what you're doing.
